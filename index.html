                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p class="justifyText">I am a 22-year-old student of the Systems and Computer Engineering program at Universidad del
                        Norte with a deep passion for development and programming. Since I was 11, I have been
                        fascinated by computers and how they work, which has fueled my interest in technology. My love
                        for mathematics, classical music, and the piano reflects my penchant for precision and
                        creativity. In addition, science fiction movies about artificial intelligence fuel my curiosity
                        and enthusiasm for technology. I consider myself a disciplined, committed, and responsible
                        person, always willing to give my best in every project, job, and/or task. I enjoy teamwork and
                        I stand out as a leader capable of listening and communicating effectively.

                            <h3>SoundUp - Real Project (1 month ago)</h3>
                            <p class="justifyText">SoundUp is a sound enhancement software developed for a sound and amplification organization in the city of Barranquilla, using Java and Maven. The project was carried out in a team of 5 people, where my role included tasks related to the calculation and visualization and separation of frequency ranges, as well as noise reduction. Advanced techniques such as dynamic and cumulative superposition by frequency and signal enhancement using the RMS index were applied. These techniques were essential to optimize the sound quality, improving both the clarity and the power of the acoustic signals.</p>

                            <h3>Tweet Analysis - Semester 7</h3>
                            <p class="justifyText">This project focused on analyzing a massive database with over 1,000,000,000 Twitter tweets, using Python. Parallelization techniques were employed to optimize large-scale data processing. The goal was to examine the relationships between users across their tweets and retweets, and visualize these relationships in a graph. The nodes in the graph were sized and colored based on the strength of the relationship, allowing for a clear representation of influence and information propagation on the platform. This project facilitated a deep understanding of social interactions on Twitter and its influence dynamics.</p>

                            <p class="justifyText">
                                PinterFull is a Java project that uses threads and sockets to create a collaborative online gaming experience. Players connect to a drawing board where one takes on the role of an artist, drawing an object or word while the others try to guess it via a chat. The implementation of threads ensures that actions are handled concurrently, and sockets facilitate real-time communication between participants. The project stands out for its ability to offer an interactive and dynamic experience, promoting both competition and collaboration.

                            <h3>Spaces Invaders Evolution - Semester 3</h3>
                            <p class="justifyText">Spaces Invaders Evolution is an innovative reinterpretation of the classic Space Invaders game, created during the pandemic. Instead of traditional spaceships and aliens, the game's ship is a syringe and the enemies are viruses, reflecting the global health context. The game features an integrated store where users can register, earn virtual currency, and purchase upgrades and customizations for their ship. Developed in Java with data management in SQL, the project not only offered an entertaining gameplay experience, but also introduced customization and trading elements, enriching the user experience and adapting to the context of its creation.</p>
